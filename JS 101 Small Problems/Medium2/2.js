P
  - Input: lengths of the 3 sides of triangle
  - Output: returns one of the four strings: ''equilateral', 'isosceles',
    'scalene', or 'invalid'.
  - Rules
    - To be a valid triangle
        - sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length 
        of the longest side.
        - every side must have a length greater than 0
        - If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.
    - Equilateral: All three sides are of equal length.
    - Isosceles: Two sides are of equal length, while the third is different.
    - Scalene: All three sides are of different lengths.
  - Hint: 
    Valid triangles must have the following two characteristics:
    1. All sides must have lengths greater than zero â€” i.e.,
    the shortest side is greater than zero (shortest > 0).
    2. The sum of the two shortest sides must be greater than the longest side
    (shortest + middle > longest).
